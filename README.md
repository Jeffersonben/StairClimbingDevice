# Stair Climbing Device

This repository contains the design and implementation details for a Remote-Controlled Stair-Climbing Device. The device employs a Rocker-Bogie Suspension Mechanism inspired by NASA's Mars Rovers, enabling it to climb stairs and traverse rugged terrains effectively. It is controlled via Bluetooth and built using economical and readily available components.

## Overview
- Stair climbing capability using the Rocker-Bogie mechanism.
- Remote control via Bluetooth.


The **Rocker Bogie Suspension Vehicle** is a type of rover widely used in planetary exploration, such as on NASA’s Mars rovers. The vehicle’s suspension system allows it to traverse rough terrain, and it is commonly used in robotics competitions and learning projects.

### Key Features:
- **Rocker Bogie Suspension**: Enables smooth traversal over uneven surfaces.
- **Arduino-controlled**: The movement of the vehicle is managed using an Arduino board.
- **Simple Circuitry**: Includes motor control circuits and wiring for the vehicle's movement.


The **Rocker Bogie Suspension System** works by:
- Distributing the vehicle’s weight across six wheels.
- Allowing the vehicle to climb stairs from varying height 3cm-25cm.
- Keeping the body of the vehicle stable.


While working on this project, I learned:
- Basics of **Arduino programming** and its integration with motors.
- Designing **simple circuits** and troubleshooting electrical components.
- Building a mechanically sound suspension system and understanding its real-world applications.


## Technologies Used

- **Arduino**: For controlling the vehicle and managing input/output operations.
- **DC Motors**: To drive the wheels.
- **Mechanical Design**: Rocker bogie suspension setup for rough terrain adaptability.
- **Adafruit-Motor-Sheild-Library**: Control Motor's speed.
